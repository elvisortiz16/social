Hi i don't have so much time to code and i have this gaps:

 * usually im code RoR in API-REST mode
 * i don't make any test usually i work with rspec
 * i don't use any design pattern (i have experience with adapter,interactor,services)

if you feel uncorfotable about my project i can expend more time on this
